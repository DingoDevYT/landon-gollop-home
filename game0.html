            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Windweaver is a fast paced 3D action platformer about strategically using your abilities you pick up throughout the level.
				The player isn't inherentely handed the abilities and are instead handed them in the form of item boxes scattered throughout the level. The collection and use then leads to time shaves and shortcuts, allowing for a fun, replayable experience.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                This project is currently a WIP that is looking to be self funded and published through the website Kickstarter. Development has been slow but steady with a small indie team, looking to release a free demo on Steam with multiplayer and a region of the game completed as something of a vertical slice.
