            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Bean Business is an indie business simulator, which was made specifically by me for my HSC Business Studies study, practicing my programming and other various skills at the same time. In the game, I've tried
                to simulate as many aspects of running and operating a business as realistically as possible, including market trends, employee hiring process, advertising, customer demand, employee interaction,
                restocking and other various elements.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                This game also incorporates a complex grid/cell based building system and AI navigation for all NPC's in the game (employees, customers etc.).
