            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Five Night's at Lachsocks is a pseudo-joke game made for a friend's birthday and twitch stream, based on Five Night's at Freddy's. Lachsocks is the name of this friend, and the game serves
                as one of my earliest works, testing the waters for some more complicated mechanics such as algorithmic pathfinding (A* specifically), along with structs, lists, superclasses, subclasses, and
                some proper 3D modelling for the game's environment.'
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The rest of the games mechanics are decently simple, such as the cameras and audio systems. The game then consists of five levels, with two bonus levels and a custom stage which allows the player
                to set their own difficulty. The value they choose tells the AI how "intelligently" it should act and move towards the player.
