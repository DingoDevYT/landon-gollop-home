            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Test your reasoning skills as you attempt to crack the secret flower code. Meanwhile, special cards can alter the game board, change pin positions, and even hide portions of your solution. Every game feels fresh with these strategic elements that can turn the tide of your logic puzzle.

                This project was created as an assessment task for my Software classes during my final year of highschool. All assets (apart from royalty free sounds) were created by me in the tools FireAlpaca and Blender - which came as a challenge since I was first learning Blender, and still in my beginner stages of learning the Unity game engine.
