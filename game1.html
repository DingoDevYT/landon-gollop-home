            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Sonic Velocity is a fan-game that has been made as a passive hobby project by a small team over the majority of the last 2 years. Sonic Velocity takes heavy inspiration from modern era Sonic games,
                implementing 3D and 2D platforming, along with abilities such as the boost, homing attack, stomp and roll. Throughout the project, a massive variety of custom assets, scripts, art and animations have been
                made to provide the player with a brand new Sonic story and experience.
            </p>

                Sonic Velocity was recently showcased at SAGE 2024, a large expo held online for Sonic Fangames each year, where people can view, watch and download fangames to try out. The game was released as an early demo
                in order to recieve feedback on the game, and find major bugs. During the SAGE expo, the game was played by a variety of youtubers and streamers.
